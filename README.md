# FDX_Arrow
Simple 2D Phyiscs.  
Implementation of 2D vectors, Vct.  
Vct supports most basic vector operations (those more useful to physics).  
Implementation of generic Shape interface, with Crl (Circle), Pnt (Point) and Rct (Rectangle).  
Shapes support contact, time to hit and movement against another shapes (calculus are made using a priori formulas).
